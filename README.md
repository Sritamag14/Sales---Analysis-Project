# Sales---Analysis-Project
This repository contains my Sales Analysis Project, which I worked on to apply my learnings from the Data Science with Python module within the Generative AI and Machine Learning course. 
I have applied techniques of data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualization to complete the project. Below is the project description:

<b> Project statement: </b>

AAL, established in 2000, is a well-known brand in Australia, particularly recognized for its clothing business. <br>
It has opened branches in various states, metropolises, and tier-1 and tier-2 cities nationwide. <br>
<br>
The brand caters to all age groups, from kids to the elderly.<br>
<br>
Currently experiencing a surge in business, AAL is actively pursuing expansion opportunities. <br>
To facilitate informed investment decisions, the CEO has assigned the responsibility to the head of AALâ€™s sales and marketing (S&M) department. 
<br>
The specific tasks include:
1)    Identify the states that are generating the highest revenues.<br>
2)    Develop sales programs for states with lower revenues. The head of sales and marketing has requested your assistance with this task.
<br>
Analyze the sales data of the company for the fourth quarter in Australia, examining it on a state-by-state basis.<br>
